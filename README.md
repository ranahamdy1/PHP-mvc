In the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture for a PHP application, the flow typically follows this process:

1- Router: The application receives a request (e.g., a URL from the browser). The Router inspects the request and matches it against predefined routes to determine which Controller should handle it. If a match is found, the router forwards the request to the appropriate controller method.

2- Controller: The Controller acts as the intermediary between the Model and the View. It receives the input from the router and processes it as needed. The controller may call methods from the Model to retrieve, update, or delete data. The logic in the controller coordinates the flow of data and defines how it will be presented to the view.

3- Model: The Model represents the data and business logic of the application. It interacts with the database to perform operations like fetching data or making updates. When called by the controller, the model executes the necessary database interactions and returns the results back to the controller.

4- Back to Controller: After receiving the data from the Model, the Controller processes it if needed and prepares it for the view. This may involve transforming or formatting the data for display.

5- View: The Controller passes the data to the View, which is responsible for rendering the data into HTML/CSS for the user. The View takes the data and presents it to the user as a complete, user-friendly web page.
